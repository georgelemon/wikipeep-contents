# Local Environment
**There are multiple ways to install WikiPeep**. Was by default developed using the **MacOS built-in PHP (8.0)** and its basic webserver, but you can go wild with [Homestead](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/homestead), with Docker, or with your custom Vagrant Box.

### Requirements
- PHP 7.4 (recommended ^8.0)
- PHP mbstring Extension
- XML Extension (For fast rendering SVG icons with DOM XML, instead of SVG Sprites/Webfonts/JavaScript)
- Composer (latest version)
- SASS Compiler
- Git

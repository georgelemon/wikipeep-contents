# 👋 Hey Peep!

**If you're viewing this from GitHub, then have a look at [WikiPeep](https://github.com/georgelemon/wikipeep) app repository.**

This directory is the place where you can put your markdown documentation contents so WikiPeep can build from it.

If you're asking, yes <code>README.md</code> file is by default ignored by WikiPeep content builder to prevent publishing this on front-end and also ignored from <code>git</code>.

If you want to see WikiPeep in action, then [go to the official page](https://georgelemon.com/wikipeep).
